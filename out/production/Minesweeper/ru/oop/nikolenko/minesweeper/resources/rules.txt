Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game.
The objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.
Mines are scattered throughout a board, which is divided into cells. Cells have three states: uncovered, covered and flagged. A covered cell is blank and clickable, while an uncovered cell is exposed. Flagged cells are those marked by the player to indicate a potential mine location.
A player left-clicks a cell to uncover it. If a player uncovers a mined cell, the game ends, as there is only 1 life per game. Otherwise, the uncovered cells displays either a number, indicating the quantity of mines adjacent to it, or a blank tile (or "0"), and all adjacent non-mined cells will automatically be uncovered. Right-clicking on a cell will flag it, causing a flag to appear on it. Flagged cells are still considered covered, and a player can click on them to uncover them, but they must first be unflagged with an additional right-click. Also, the player can press the left and right mouse buttons simultaneously or wheel button on an uncovered cell with a number. If there are as many marked cells around the clicked cell as indicated on this cell, then the remaining covered cells will automatically open.
To win the game, players must uncover all non-mine cells, at which point, the timer is stopped. Flagging all the mined cells is not required.
